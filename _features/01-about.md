Titterpig Academy started as a discord server for a group of diverse content creators to help people learn TTRPGs beyond 5e. We've decided that just running games and answering questions in Discord isn't enough, so we're branching out. Titterpig Academy is expanding as a brand, we are starting a podcast called Titterpig Radio which will discuss different aspects of the RPG hobby. We are also working on establishing a bigger social media presence, and hope to bring you all quality TTRPG content in many forms such as videos, podcasts, and blog posts.
